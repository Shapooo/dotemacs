;;; init-windows.el --- Working with windows within frames -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; This is not about the "Windows" OS, but rather Emacs's "windows"
;; concept: these are the panels within an Emacs frame which contain
;; buffers.

;;; Code:

(when (require-package 'switch-window)
  (setq-default switch-window-shortcut-style 'alphabet
                switch-window-timeout nil)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") 'switch-window))

;; When splitting window, show (other-buffer) in the new window

(defun split-window-func-with-other-buffer (split-function)
  (lambda (&optional arg)
    "Split this window and switch to the new window unless ARG is provided."

    (let ((target-window (next-window)))
      (set-window-buffer target-window (other-buffer))
